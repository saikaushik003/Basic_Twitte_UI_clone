# Basic_Twitter(X)_UI_clone
My first project, a minimalist Twitter UI clone, showcases a sleek, responsive design inspired by modern social media aesthetics. Featuring a dynamic dark mode toggle, this project demonstrates my early skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating intuitive user interfaces. It serves as a foundation for my web development journey, emphasizing clean code and user experience.
