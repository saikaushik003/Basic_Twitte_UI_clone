# Basic_Twitter(X)_UI_clone
#### My first project, a minimalist Twitter UI clone, showcases a sleek, responsive design inspired by modern social media aesthetics. Featuring a dynamic dark mode toggle, this project demonstrates my early skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating intuitive user interfaces. It serves as a foundation for my web development journey, emphasizing clean code and user experience.

#### Real Twitter: The hover effect on the "X" button provides a subtle indication of interactivity, preparing users for the action that will occur upon clicking.

### Our Clone

#### My Clone: By introducing a circular expansion effect on hover, our button offers a more pronounced interactive feedback compared to the real Twitter's more subdued effect. This can make the interface feel more dynamic and engaging for users.("You have the flexibility to implement the desired functionality for the buttons.")
